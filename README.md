# hard-drive-storage-mail-excel
This VBA code is an automation of sending an email, that contains the free space on a specific drive(in this case "X:"), and also logs the date, time and the free space on the drive in an excel sheet, and creates a graph chart of the data. It uses the Outlook application to send the email and the FileSystemObject to check the free space on the drive.
